# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

The capstone will build upon the knowledge you have gained in the course in order to build a decentralized housing product. 

* Project was completed with outdated Solidity version and NPM dependencies; however, these are all still currently stable and secure. Oraclize has been replaced with ProvableThings, but that is the only major change.
